This project captures the preliminary data clean up on three air quality 
datasets collected from the RDU airport between the years 2018 and 2020 (with
recorded data up to April) for the purpose of examining the relationship 
between Air Quality and Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) in Durham County, NC. This 
association is given previous literature on possible aggragation of symptoms
SCD patients have with poor air quality.

In this project, we examine three pollutants: Carbon, Ozone (O3), and Particle 
Matter 2.5 (particles of size 2.5mm or less). 

Preliminary work with the three data sets for each was done to better analyze
the results. This was done using a function that fixes variable names, fixes
formatting of dates, makes corrections to measurement errors and addresses 
duplicate measures. 

In 2018 some data points from 9/13-9/18 were not recorded and not included in the 
full analysis. Similarly, due to possibly when the data collection was done we
only have data up until April of 2020 (reflected in Plot 2). 

After addressing issues in the data all data sets were combined and analysis on
pollutant concentrations was done in Plot 1for Ozone and CO concentration and 
exmaiantion of concentration of particles of size 2.5 or less was examined in 
Plot 2. 

Further analysis on the tables is included in the "Project2_Khan.qmd" file on
the repository.
